        I live in Victoria, Canada with my partner and our cat, Dad. Sometimes I play like seven
        instruments, or Breath of the Wild on Switch. I like making pretentious cocktails and
        drinking them with pretentious people.

        I spent the last four years at
        <a href="https://getzipline.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zipline</a> building products
        that hundreds of thousands of people use daily.

<h1>Diamond Stereo</h1>
<p><em>Diamond Stereo's</em> newspaper advertisements were in dire need of an update. The audio/visual store's sale items were often lost in a mass of drop-shadow effects, a grey gradient background, and buried copy. There was really only one thing to do; scrap everything and start again.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.</strong><br /><font size="-1">&rsaquo; Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</font></blockquote>
<p>The famous quote about perfection being achieved by removing was in mind, so taking that minimalist approach felt like the appropriate starting point. A clean, white background; strong hierarchy and prominent headlines; matter-of-fact information—simplicity. A reflection effect on the product images was added for just the right amount of subtle polish. And that's it. Nothing left to remove.</p>

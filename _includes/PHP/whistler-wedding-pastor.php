<h1>Whistler Wedding Pastor</h1>
<section>
<p>When Jer reached out for <a href="http://www.whistlerweddingpastor.com" target="_blank">whistlerweddingpastor.com</a> I was excited to work on it. His audience was cool, young, often outdoorsy, and sophisticated. He wanted the site to capture the sense adventure in the Whistler wilderness without being campy.</p>
<p>I drew a lot of inspiration from Wes Anderson, paying extra attention to typography, textures, and artwork. The photos Jer provided were great so I utilized them as much as possible. He also mentioned he'd be using the blog frequently so I spent a fair bit of time making it look great and super simple to use.</p>
<p>He was really happy with it, saying "[Brian] took some really vague ideas I had and turned them into gold. Building the site from scratch, he was super easy to work with, fast, and I highly recommend him."</p>
<p>Looks like the story has a happy ending.</p>

<h1>Still</h1>
<p><em>Still,</em> the second release from <a href="http://modernlakes.bandcamp.com">Modern Lakes</a> dove further into the dark and moodier sounds of indie-rock. Its ambient textures and melancholy melodies emphasized the lonely and introspective lyrics while an aggressive and driving rhythm section magnified a certain restlessness that was present underneath.</p>
<p>Most of the songs had existed in some form for years prior to recording and releasing the ep, but reworking them with the rest of the band gave them new life. We recorded the music over a few days in the Factory in Vancouver and completed the vocal recordings slowly over the next few months.</p>

To help back-end developers on my team release user interfaces faster, I created a reusable component library in <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>, influenced by <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React</a>. Rather than worrying about CSS, they call components with a Rails helper, pass in its props, and have it styled appropriately.

A year later I gave a Lightning Talk at the <a href="http://vanruby.org" target="_blank">Van Ruby Meetup</a> to share the concept since it was working so well.

_Start-up Colour_ is an off-hand joke between a friend and I. It seems every successful start-up eventually changes their brand colour to some shade of blue, which must mean blue is the most successful colour. Right? Sure.

Users answer a _very serious questionaire_ that recommends the best colour to use for their start-up. They'll answer questions like "What fields are you disrupting?" and "What are your office perks?" which is then processed by _sophisticated AI_ to determine brand colour to guarantee success.

_Start-up Colour_ is an off-hand joke between a friend and I. It seems every successful start-up eventually changes their brand colour to some shade of blue, which must mean blue is the most successful colour. Right? Sure.

Users answer a short questionnaire processed by _sophisticated AI_ that recommends the best colour to use. By entering how disruptive they are, how many ping-pong tables they have, and if they have beer taps in their exposed-brick office, they'll get a colour that guarantees their success. Spoiler alert: it's blue.

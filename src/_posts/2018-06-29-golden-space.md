Curious if there was a perfect space system for web applications, I created _Golden Space_ to try out different ratios and techniques. Ultimately, I didn't uncover the _one true ratio_, but found hand-picking gaps that roughly resembled the Golden Ratio seemed to work best. Hence, the _brass ratio_.

This project also became a playground to practice with some tech I enjoy. I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*" target="_blank">CSS Custom Properties</a> to dynamically change the ratios, <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="blank">TypeScript</a> to mimic the <a href="https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/" target="_blank">Elm Architecture</a> outside of Elm, <a href="https://jestjs.io" target="_blank">Jest</a> for tests, and <a href="https://parceljs.org" target="blank">Parcel</a> for bundling assets.

_Think Like a Programmer_ is a 30-minute course I created with the <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/" target="_blank">Skillshare</a> expansion team to help designers, marketers, and product managers work better with developers. Students learn ways to apply high-level programming concepts to their job and gain insights into how developers approach problems.

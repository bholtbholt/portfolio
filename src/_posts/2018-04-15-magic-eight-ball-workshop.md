I taught students <a href="https://elm-lang.org" target="_blank">Elm</a> through a hands-on workshop I lead at Code and Conf, a conference presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/codecoffeeyvr" target="_blank">Code and Coffee Meetup</a> in Vancouver. After I provided an introduction and Q&A session, we worked through exercises where everyone created Magic-Eight Balls. If you'd like, you can <a href="https://github.com/bholtbholt/magic-eight" target="_blank">complete the workshop</a> yourself!

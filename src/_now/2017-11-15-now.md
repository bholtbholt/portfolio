Today is my first day at <a href="https://www.retailzipline.com" target="_blank">Retail Zipline</a>, a SAAS that helps large retailers execute their vision better. The team is 100% remote, tight-knit, and very experienced. I'm coming on primarily as a front-end developer who will be responsible for front-end architecture, feature development, implementing designs, and performance. But, since it's a <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a> application, I'll get to do full-stack development with the back-end team. I can't wait to get started!

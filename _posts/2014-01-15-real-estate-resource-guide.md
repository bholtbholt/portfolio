<h1>Real Estate Resource Guide</h1>
<section>
<p>With the real estate market booming in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows, the News published a guide to assist buyers, sellers, and those interested in it. It featured buying and selling advice, realtor contacts, and various articles about the communities.  I created a design that was clean, contemporary, and corporate that reflected the communities. It won first place in Best Real Estate or Homes Publication 2012, from the <a href="http://www.suburban-news.org" target="_new">Local Media Association</a>.

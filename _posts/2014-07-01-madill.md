<h1>Madill Equipment</h1>
<section>
<p>In the Madill Equipment project I was asked to rebuild their CMS site into a regular php site. Their CMS site had several problems with its responsiveness and the client was having trouble editing information (because the CMS site was all built on slide shows). I took their PSD mockups and replicated them in a responsive environment perfectly.</p>

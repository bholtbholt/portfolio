<h1>My Community</h1>
<section>
<P>For everything Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows, members of the community only needed to read <em>My Community.</em> The annual magazine published by the Maple Ridge Pitt Meadows News showcased local things to see and do, events, and articles relevant to living in the area. My goal in the design and branding was to make the magazine familiar yet new and exciting.</P>
<p>Using vibrant colours I made the articles look fresh and interesting while local photos and Verdana as the typeface made them look familiar. The logo design used Walburn for its historical look—especially in regards to the News—and Verdana for a contemporary contrast. The contrast was used because the communities have architecture that has been around since pioneer times as well as a lot of new modern developments.</p></section>

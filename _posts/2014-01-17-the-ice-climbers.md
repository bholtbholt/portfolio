<h1>The Ice Climbers</h1>
<section>
<p>If there's a pair more qualified to talk about teamwork, you'll need to let me know, because as far as I'm concerned, this duo is the essence of what true teamwork is. Scaling mountains to bother pterodactyls (is that what that bird is?), wearing matching clothes, being generally useless and difficult to control in Super Smash Bros. But doing all of that <em>together</em>. That's teamwork. Or codependency.</p>
<p>I certainly need a reason to paint things, right? It'd be too senseless to paint two nearly identical faces on canvas just because I liked the sketch I drew. The story is important. Is art without meaning still art?</p></section>

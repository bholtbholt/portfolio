<h1>Fitma</h1>
<section>
<p>"I'm a bio-mechanic." That was one of the first ways Andre described himself and Fitma to me. It's a program about fluidity and movement, an idea about being centred and grounded, and a way to reach peak human potential.</p>
<p>I selected Meta for the logo because of its humanist touch paired with sturdiness. The font looks fluid <em>and</em> grounded. The icon was designed while exploring the sense of movement in various angles and shapes. The <a href="http://www.fitma4you.com" target="_blank">Fitma website</a> was put together on SquareSpace as a way to keep the budget down.</p>

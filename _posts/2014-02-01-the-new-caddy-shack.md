<h1>The New Caddy Shack</h1>
<section>
<p>When given the New Caddy Shack account I was told its <em>Blue Collar Hour</em> was the best deal in town, but the club was still empty. The reason why seemed obvious to me: the current advertisement featured a woman's naked chest with starbursts covering her nipples, trapped behind a chain-link fence, with police caution tape crossed over her, then on top of all that, three or four promotions scrawled across the ad space in grunge text. I hadn't even realized there was <em>a single</em> promotion until I stared at it long enough to decipher what the letters spelt amiss the chaos. The advertisement was clearly being overlooked.</p>
<p>Since the club was under new ownership, I took the opportunity to give the brand a refresh. No more trashy strippers caught on the wrong side of a chain-link fence. No more caution signs warning patrons to stay away. No more starbursts and grunge text. The New Caddy Shack had cleaned up its club and I would clean up their ads.</p>
<p>It might come as a surprise, but it's somewhat difficult to find a photo for a strip club that doesn't scream SEEDY. I wanted something subtle, and found an image that wasn't <em>actually</em> explicit, but implied it. The headline I wrote was flirtatious with its play on words, and minimal copy simplified the "best deal in town". That should attract a bit of attention. And it did more than a little.</p>
<p>During the four weeks the advertisement ran, readers bickered back and forth (via letters to the editor) about the establishment's campaign. People who were "not prude" claimed the image was corrupting youth and causing the "downward spiral of our society". Others argued there was nothing wrong or shocking with it; that it wouldn't "teach them something they don't already know". Needless to say, the New Caddy Shack was no longer being ignored.</p>

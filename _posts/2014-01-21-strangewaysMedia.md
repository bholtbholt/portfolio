<p>Strangeways Media described themselves to me as a progressive new media production company who had evolved with each new advancement in technology. Their primary focus was web development and video, and they wanted their logo to reflect that.</p>
<p>I selected a font that echoed the lines and letterforms of early computer programming languages. Its clean, stiff lines made it recognizable as a computer-type font, yet it's rounded ends and curves added a touch of personality. Beneath the wordmark I created a series of growing boxes which hinted movement and nodded towards a film strip.</p>

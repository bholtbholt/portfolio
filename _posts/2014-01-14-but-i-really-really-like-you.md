<h1>But I Really, Really Like You</h1>
<section>
<p>Recently I read a quote by Morrissey that said something to the effect of 'the title is the most important part of the song'. I relate; that exact thought is was what drove <em>But I Really, Really Like you</em>.</p>
<p>I wondered two things one day: what a monster would look like, and what it would be doing. I had come back from a sour date when the idea popped into my head. I guess I was wondering what went wrong. I suppose I wasn't that funny—I get jokes…<em>really</em>. Maybe she thought I was bland. Or that I came on too strong—that was probably it.</p>
<p>So that answers what a monster might be doing; not understanding what coming on too strong means. What would he look like? Does it matter? He's a monster. Run away.</p>

<h1>ClinicAid</h1>
<section>
<p>ClinicAid is a cloud-based medical billing system that "allows a billing item to be entered and submitted in less than five seconds on average". I thought that statement alone was incredible and focused the messaging on having more time.</p>
<p>Two of the three headlines targeted doctors&mdash;appealing to their sense of duty or sense of humour&mdash;while the third targeted those who actually did the billing. The remaining copy was written to explain what ClinicAid was in less than five seconds.</p>

<h1>Carolyn & Jesse's Wedding Invitation</h1>
<section>
<p>Being huge music fans and avid concert-goers, Carolyn and Jesse wanted a wedding invitation that was reminiscent of a concert poster. For inspiration and style, I was directed to some Bob Masse and art-nouveau images, but asked to make it brighter and more colourful.</p>
<p>Since Jesse is in the Navy, I suggested a dramatic, romantic, <em>Pearl Harbour</em> type of pose. Using Illustrator, I drew simple geometric shapes with minimal details to create a bit of a cell-shaded, digital look rather than the typical organic feel. Minimalist wording in a traditional typeface tied everything back to the concert-poster idea.</p>

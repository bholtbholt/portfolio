<h1>All My Friends</h1>
<p>All My Friends are an upbeat synth-pop duo from Vancouver. Their fans are kids who grew up on console video games and their nostalgia-filled lyrics emphasized youthfulness. If there was a single word to summarize the band, it would need to be "fun".</p>
<p>With their album artwork I sought to magnify the attitude of each release. Their debut, <em>I Have No Faith in Machines,</em> was a collection of pop songs underneath a frantic drum and synth ensemble. They used a variety of 8-bit inspired sounds and called it "video-game music". I suggested a throw-back to arcade-style beat 'em up games because it echoed the excitement present through each song. We found a local artist to draw the band for the front cover and another to do 8-bit versions of the duo for the disc.</p>
<p><em>That's What Christmas is All About</em> was a free EP the band released as a gift for their fans. I'm not sure there's anything that says 'childhood Christmas' more than <em>Merry Christmas Charlie Brown</em>, so I drew the duo as Charlie Brown and Linus in the famous tree-picking scene.</p>
<p>I kept the video-game theme present in their concert posters. I combined serval screenshots, or borrowed promotional materials from various games to turn them into attention capturing posters In a city that was over-saturated with event posters. Fans loved them so much that All My Friends were asked for additional copies.</p>
<p>When designing their website, I treated the domain as a central hub for fans to find anything All My Friends. The band didn't want to devote more time online&mdash;they wanted to make music&mdash;and since they had an active online presence between Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, bringing those together was the most efficient design move. Links to their social media, music hosting platform, and contact information kept their website simple, and a Twitter feed linked to each member's personal account was added to ensure their page would stay updated.</p>
<p>When Twitter revoked access to their users' streams, I updated their site to display their music videos. In December 2013, All My Friends released another Christmas song and I updated their website to match the mood. The most logical design move was to make the background <em>actually</em> snow. So that's what I did.</p>

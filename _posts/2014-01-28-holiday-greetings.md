<h1>Holiday Greetings</h1>
<section>
<p>Holiday Greetings was an annual feature where both advertisers and community members could send each other good wishes during the holiday season. With Christmas songs trapped in my head, these are a few ads I wrote and designed that I liked.</p>
<p>When designing the <strong>Holiday Greetings Cover</strong> and layout, I aimed to romanticize the feature. I chose American Typewriter to nod toward its beginnings when people  actually <em>mailed in</em> their greetings, then looked for them in the paper. In choosing photos I sought out families that were reflective of the community.</p>
<p><strong>Fetch a Bone</strong> had initially submitted pages of sales they wanted crammed into the ad space, but I focused it on their most important special. And once it was paired with that pup's face, how could anybody say no to a new toy?</p>
<p>How do you create an optimistic holiday advertisement for a law firm who mostly handle collisions and injuries? For <strong>Fowle & Company</strong> I used just a bit of humour.</p>
<p>I'd be flattered if <strong>Urban Eyewear</strong> replaced their eye charts with my advertisement leading up to the New Year, but I understand if they need something more technical. (I'm not an eye doctor&#151;do eye charts become technical? They should just use it.)</p>
<p>Continuing with the rebrand I developed earlier in the year, these <strong>Pyrgos Taverna</strong> ads reminded people that this Greek restaurant loved celebrating Christmas time.</p>

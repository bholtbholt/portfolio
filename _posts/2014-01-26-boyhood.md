<h1>Boyhood</h1>
<section>
<p>Call this print an ode to youth if you'd like. I was riding my bike around my hometown listening to <a href="http://ohnoyoko.com">Oh No! Yoko's</a> track <a href="http://ohnoyoko.bandcamp.com/track/boyhood">Boyhood</a> when I came up with the idea. After sorting through 26 years of photos I decided upon 225 to immortalize in the collage.<br/>Now I feel old, but it looks like I had fun doing it.</p>

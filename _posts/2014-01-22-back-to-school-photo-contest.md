<h1>Back to School Photo Contest</h1>

<p>My first day of <em>real</em> school was an awful cry-fest. I had already attended preschool and a half-year of kindergarten, but this was different. I was about to be left to the mercy of a strange teacher for a six-hour day. All I really wanted to do was play Super Mario Brothers 3 and draw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p>
<p>Standing in the lineup, I begged and pleaded for my mom to set me free. <em>How could she abandon me? Did she even know what they were going to do to me?</em> To my dismay, I was escorted inside, to a desk, at the sound of a warning bell.</p>
<p>It seemed that the teacher knew I wasn't happy being in her territory. She tried to bribe me with a colouring book full of Sesame Street characters printing the alphabet. <em>Shouldn't she know I already knew how to write the alphabet?</em> I was unimpressed, but I knew I could outsmart her by finishing all the pages before she came back. She'd have to let me go home then.</p>
<p>As I was nearing the final strokes of the letter Q, the teacher interrupted the classroom with the next activity. I quickly tried to race through the remaining letters, but one of her cohorts snatched the book from me. When I insisted on finishing it <em>now,</em> she condescendingly remarked how cute I was and that I could finish tomorrow. <em>Tomorrow!? As if I'm ever coming back here!</em></p>
<p>We carried on with various activities and when that warning bell rang again, we were herded outside. <em>Finally, I have a chance to escape!</em> With a breath of fresh air I looked out at my world only to find my mom waiting for me. Unabashedly, I raced toward her; she had come to rescue me. When she asked how my first day was, I was startled. <em>The entire day? It's over?</em> It turned out that teacher had some sort of time-control device that made the excruciating days go by quickly. Unfortunately, it seems in the chaos of that first day no pictures were taken to verify these events. You'll have to take my word for it.</p>

Since the pandemic hit, my friends and I could no longer gather 'round a table to yell at each other for being a spy in the boardgame <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Resistance</a> (also known as <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Avalon</a>). So I created a realtime remote version to maintain our weekly scream quotas. You can play it too, as long as you bring your own friends!

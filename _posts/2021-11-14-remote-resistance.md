Since the pandemic hit, my friends and I could no longer gather 'round a table to yell at each other for being a spy in the boardgame <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Resistance</a> (also known as <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Avalon</a>). So I created a realtime remote version to maintain our weekly scream quotas.

I've taken it offline since publishing, but you can fork it and self-host if you'd like!

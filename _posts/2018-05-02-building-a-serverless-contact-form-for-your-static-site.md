Finding static site generators useful in my own projects, I wrote an article that solved a common problem. Static sites have no server that contact forms can submit to, but by using the <a href="https://serverless.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Serverless Framework</a>, I showed readers how to get more out of their site so they wouldn't be forced to switch to a CMS.

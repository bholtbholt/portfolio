<h1>53 Squares</h1>
<section><p>You'll need: a canvas, at least the three primary colours, a paintbrush, a palette, and painter's tape (or masking tape).<br/>Optional accessories: a ruler, water to clean the brush, an album or two to listen to, a drink.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Divide and tape the canvas into an even set of squares. Make sure to include the tape width. <em>Note: This may get less important as you get closer to the edge and realize you've forgotten how to do grade-four-level division. You'll end up with odd white borders thatâ€”never mind.</em></li>
	<li>Squeeze out a bunch of paint onto your palette and mix a new colour. Apply paint to your brush and then to one of the canvas squares. For straight, sharp lines paint right over the tape.</li>
	<li>Repeat step 2 until you <del>get bored</del> think of a clever reason to leave a bunch of spaces white.</li>
	<li>Count how many squares are coloured and title your piece with that number. Alternatively/abstractly/artfully you could count the blank space and title your piece that way, then write about how the colour is actually a distraction to the simple elegance of a blank canvas. <em>Note: Extra credibility for drawing an analogy from blank canvas to open mind/imagination.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>It's just like <em>paint by numbers</em>. See, art is easy!</p>

<h1>The Cost of Success</h1>
<section>
<p>How does one measure success? It seems to be both a relative and internal scale determined by ambition. And what drives ambition? I'm not sure where I got my love/hate relationship with that.</p>
<p>At one time I felt like success could be measured, tracked, and predicted like a stock with a determined attitude and hard work. Whatever effort I put into something would be, at minimum, equally reciprocated into the results I desired. With persistent focus I'd get what I wanted. Sacrifices would need to be made but those sacrifices were less important than the goal. A true sense of 'the end justifies the means'.</p>
<p>Time passed and I began questioning my wants. Was my idea of success distorted? How could I determine that? What would make it honest? How important was it to be "successful"?</p>
<p>Another <del>clich√©</del> idea was re-introduced to me as well; the journey vs. destination in terms of happiness. While I enjoyed my (seemingly endless) pursuits, I had begun to feel that I was missing other equally-enjoyable pastimes. That feeling eventually consumed me so much that my focus shifted to what I was missing out on because of blind ambition.</p>
<p>The irony in the pursuit of success happened when, one day I realized I had been chasing pastimes in spite of goals for so long, that it had become the goal itself. I had begun to miss that blind, ambitious drive and its selfish ability to command my life. A sense of balance was obviously missing, but more so, a sense of purpose. Yet I still craved success, not fully knowing what that meant.</p>
<p>Would I be doomed to repeat myself in cycles hoping to achieve something everlasting, like the tree cycles through the seasons shedding its leaves but eventually leaving its mark in the forest? Would I be the lone, remembered trunk or one of the countless, forgotten leaves?</p>

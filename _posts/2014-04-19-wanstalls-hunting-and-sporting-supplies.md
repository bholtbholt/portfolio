<h1>Wanstalls Hunting & Sporting Supplies</h1>
<section>
<p>The only guns I've ever fired have been connected to a Nintendo (with a wire) or loaded with caps. Aka: they were made from plastic and are not at all threatening to a 6 point buck, grizzly, or undomesticated house-cat. Come to think of it, they were hardly even threatening to my brother who evidently had better make-believe aim than I did.</p>
<p>Wanstalls had received a new shipment of the industry-standard hunting rifle, the Springfield Armory M1A Standard, and wanted to promote it without being tacky. Knowing next to nothing about guns, I spent an afternoon researching the rifle and Wanstalls' customer base in order to come up with an effective ad.</p>
<p>While flipping through photos of fresh kills made by the hunting community in Maple Ridge, I let my mind wander in order to come up with the ad copy. I noticed the hunters were all very proud of their prey, so I wanted to portray that in the headline. Like a cowboy ad. Or Texas Ranger. Or Highlander. Something with strength and attitude. Since it was 2012, my mind eventually went to zombies and survivalism and I came up with "If only the strong survive, then I'm sure glad I brought my M1A."</p>
<p>A hunter armed with the industry-standard rifle would certainly be a good partner to last the zombie apocalypse. Although, as long as he didn't become a zombie, I think Iâ€™d side with Highlander.</p>

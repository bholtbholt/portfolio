<h1>Sweet Sweet Honey Bucket</h1>
<section>
<p>Classic-rock and blues band <em>Sweet Sweet Honey Bucket</em> had a loose, loud, and energetic style with an attitude that made it apparent they really loved the stage. There was a certain sense of freedom with a hint of rebellion reminiscent of 1950s America. Developing a brand borrowed from iconic Golden-Age American culture seemed perfect. After all, what's more classic-rock than girls in muscle cars?</p>
<p>For their concert flyers, I recreated classic movie posters, replacing the movie text with information pertaining to the event. The fonts and colours were matched to maintain the integrity of the originals, and further the bands' connection to the era.</p>
<p>Their record artwork was created from an old GTO advertisement, simplified, and edited for the band. I also created a promotional hand-out, that was placed on table tops at pubs prior to an event, using the cover design so audience members would recognize the artwork upon seeing a physical copy of the record.</p>

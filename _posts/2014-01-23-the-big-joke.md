<h1>The Big Joke</h1>
<section>
<p>I'm not sure if the King James, New American, or some other translation is to blame, but I feel that with this updated passage <del>Christians</del> people everywhere would be a lot less angry and stressed. Especially when arguing which deity's rules are the right ones to follow.</p>
<p>Just kidding. I take these things <em>very</em> seriously. #existentialism</p>

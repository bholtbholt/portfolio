<h1>Cohen Buchan Edwards</h1>
<section>
<p>Cohen Buchan Edwards' site was last updated in 2008, and since the redesign project started in late 2013 there was a lot to be done. All the pages were designed to be full-width and fully-responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop displays. I used large banner images for larger screens that scaled down on smaller displays. And by extending Wordpress functionality I was able to build a really intuitive backend for their custom theme.</p>

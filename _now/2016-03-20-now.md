I've begun teaching User Experience Foundations as well as Branding and Visual Design at <a href="https://redacademy.com/vancouver/" target="_blank">Red Academy</a>, a tech and design bootcamp in Vancouver. I'm working with another UX instructor make improvements to the course curriculum to best prepare new students in the industry.

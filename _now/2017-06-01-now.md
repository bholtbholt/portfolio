Completed a super fun project focused on building micro-service UIs. I built the API that rendered JSON data from the <a href="https://rubyonrails.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Ruby on Rails</a> application, then jumped into building the <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">React</a> front-end with Maca.

Our three-person team finished the initial scope so quickly, we got to spend the remaining few weeks exploring iterative improvements and enhancements. I dove into <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Service Workers</a> to see if we could use them to cache our front-end UIs, and also converted the project to <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TypeScript</a>.

Next up, I'll be moving to another JavaScript team to work on Convertibles, <a href="https://unbounce.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Unbounce's</a> pop-up and sticky footer product.
